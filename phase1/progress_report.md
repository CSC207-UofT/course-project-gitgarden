# Progress Report

## Open Questions

We're still not sure how many design patterns our code will need: where they will go, how they will work, and how they will connect to the existing structure.


## What Worked Well

We decided to identify what we wanted to do in phase 1 at the beginning, and split up the group work so everyone had a very clear picture of what they needed to do. As certain group members finished their tasks, they started slowly connecting the program together as the other members wrapped up their work in the higher levels of the program.

Our use of Clean Architecture has helped us greatly this phase. Two of the main tasks were the implementation of a web-based user interface and the use of a database, so there was a lot of work to be done in the top layer for phase 1. However, this didn't stop us from finishing the work in the bottom three layers so it was ready to connect once the rest was done.


## Group Member contributions

We identified seven tasks for phase 1 we wanted to complete. The first names are those who designed the features, and those who contributed are also listed.

- User Interface: **Patrick + Melaney + Jagat + Divit** 
- Data Persistency: **Mark + Divit**
- Preferences & RankingManager: **Onyx**
- Request & Entities: **Andy + Onyx**
- Feedback Refactoring: **Onyx + Patrick**
- Testing: **Andy + Onyx**
- Design Document: **Everyone**

## Future Plan

While we don't yet have a firm grasp of what we want to do in phase 2, we each have our piece of the code we've been implementing, and are likely to continue that way. For example, the UI team will likely be improving the UI, and any additional tweaking of a class will probably be done by whoever's worked on that class the most.

As after phase 0, we want to expand our code's handling of different scenarios and introduce features that make our program one which could be used in the real world. This may include user-reported statistics, functionality to block a user, improvement to our ranking system, and etc.
