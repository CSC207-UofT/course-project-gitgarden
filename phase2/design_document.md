## Usage of Clean Architecture


## Usage of SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle
In the previous phase, we were told about how there were too many responsibilities given to some classes, specifically those containing code for Data Persistency. We resolved this by creating a new class JsonProvider that handles the saving of data. Earlier, this code was present in the WelcomePage class, which was incorrect, since that class was related to presenting the user with an opening screen, and not the saving of files. Further, we added separate classes, such as RequestManager to exclusively handle requests, as opposed to the umbrella class ServiceController which was used for this purpose prior. The latter class still exists, however, itâ€™s responsibilities have been reduced by creating new classes such as RatingManager and DataPresenter. This was relatively easy to follow in case of entity classes, due to the fact that each entity by nature is defined to serve a specific purpose. For instance, User represents a parent for both Farmers and Distributors, and there is not much confusion on its responsibilities- it needs to store information common to both subtypes of itself as parameters, as well as have getters and setters for said parameters.

#### Open/Closed Principle

#### Liskov Substitution Principle: 

#### Interface Segregation Principle: 

#### Dependency Inversion Principle: 


## Packaging Strategies


## Design Patterns

#### Factory Method

We are using the concept of factory method in creating users and its subclass. We attempt to delay the instantiation of these concrete products in the profile manager with separate factories, with each creator correlates to a unique class of user product.

#### Composite

We are using the Composite design pattern to implement a recursive structure in our code. Requests can contain other Requests, or contain an Offer. The Offer class is the leaf class in this structure, and we terminate the recursion once we get to an offer. This structure matched what the pattern is used to facilitate.
